# The-Managers-Adventure

The Manager's Adventure is an Electronic Strategic Intervention Material (E-SIM) for Senior High School students. The project was recognized and made possible in collaboration with the Department of Education, Olongapo City.

It is a simple platformer game based on a subject about Management. It is developed using HTML, CSS, JS, Phaser JS and Electron JS. The system was deployed to different schools in Olongapo City.

I was assigned as the Project Manager | Programmer for this project.
